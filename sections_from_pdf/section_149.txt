Editorial Information

The insertion of the new cross-heading "Nature reserves, marine nature reserves and Ramsar sites"
in Part II on 1.10.2006 gives rise to a change in the structure of this legislation on SLD which breaks
the continuity of historical versions of the existing provisions which are now brought under that new
heading.
