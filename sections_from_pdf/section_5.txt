[F47957A Consolidation of definitive maps and statements.
(1) Where—
(a)
different definitive maps and statements relate to different parts of a surveying
authority’s area,
(b)
as respects so much of each definitive map and statement as relates to that
area the requirements of section 53(2), and of section 55 so far as it applies,
have been complied with, and
(c)
there is no part of that area to which no definitive map and statement relate,
the authority may, if it appears to them expedient to do so, prepare a map and statement
comprising copies of so much of each definitive map and statement as relates to the
authority’s area; and where they do so the map and statement so prepared and not, so
far as copied, the earlier maps and statements shall be regarded for the purposes of
sections 53 to 56 and 57(2) and (3) as the definitive map and statement for the area
to which they relate.
(2) The power conferred by subsection (1) is not exercisable by a surveying authority if
the definitive map and statement relating to any part of the authority’s area is a map
and statement in respect of which a review under section 33 of the 1949 Act was
begun before the commencement date but has been neither abandoned in pursuance
of a direction under section 55(1) nor completed.
(3) References in subsection (1) to a definitive map and statement are, in the case of a
map and statement modified in accordance with any of the foregoing provisions of
this Part, references to the map and statement as modified.
(4) The statement prepared under subsection (1) shall specify, as the relevant date for the
purposes of the map, such date, not being earlier than six months before the preparation
of the map and statement, as the authority may determine.
(5) Every surveying authority shall take such steps as they consider expedient for bringing
to the attention of the public the preparation by them of any map and statement under
subsection (1).]
