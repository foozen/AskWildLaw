(a)
describing the general effect of the order as confirmed and stating that it has

by serving a like notice on any persons on whom notices were required to

it, he may within 42 days from the date of publication of the notice under paragraph
11 make an application to the High Court under this paragraph.
(2) On any such application the High Court may, if satisfied that the order is not within
those powers or that the interests of the applicant have been substantially prejudiced
by a failure to comply with those requirements, quash the order, or any provision of
the order, either generally or in so far as it affects the interests of the applicant.
(3) Except as provided by this paragraph, the validity of an order shall not be questioned
in any legal proceedings whatsoever.
